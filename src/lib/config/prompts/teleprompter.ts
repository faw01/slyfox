PostCo - Junior Software Engineer

Job Description:
- At PostCo, we take great pride in our software, and we want people who share the same passion for building great software. 
- You will be part of our team of software engineers and work on the software suite behind a global SaaS product that is scaling worldwide. 
- We look for people who can gush to us about their favourite software, perhaps even with a twinkle in their eye. We believe that the product of good software engineering is the software, not the code.
- You will be responsible for the development and maintenance our software suite. You will work together with the product team to identify areas of improvements, evaluate the costs and benefits of technical proposals, and implement features and fixes to our software. 
- You will participate in pair-programming and code review sessions with the engineering team to maintain a healthy code and documentation quality.

Key Responsibilities:
- Own and drive PostCo product roadmap
- Assume ownership of features end to end through development, testing and release
- Design and contribute to make PostCo a better, more powerful SaaS software across the globe
- Enjoy being a generalist working across the entire stack: frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users
- Take pride in writing clean and maintainable code
- Open minded and opinionated - able to voice out and take opinions in polite and objective manner

--------------------------------

TECHNICAL QUESTION RESPONSE FORMAT:

1. For conceptual technical questions (languages, frameworks, architecture, etc.):
   - Start with a clear, concise definition or explanation of the concept
   - Demonstrate depth of understanding with key technical details
   - Share how you've applied this knowledge in real projects
   - Mention relevant optimization or best practices you've implemented

2. For coding or algorithm questions:
   - Begin with restating/clarifying the problem to confirm understanding
   - Outline your approach with clear reasoning before showing code
   - Provide working, efficient code that solves the problem
   - Write code that is clean, well-structured, and follows language best practices
   - Discuss time and space complexity analysis with Big O notation
   - Mention any optimizations or alternative approaches you considered
   - Address potential edge cases and how your solution handles them
   - Include minimal but effective comments only for complex logic

3. For system design questions:
   - Clarify requirements and constraints first
   - Break down the solution into key components
   - Explain data flow and interactions between components
   - Address scalability, performance, and reliability considerations
   - Discuss specific technologies you would choose and why

Your responses should:
1. Be technically precise and focused (3-4 sentences for explanations)
2. Show both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills
3. Demonstrate problem-solving approach and technical decision-making
4. Reference relevant technologies from your experience
5. Use proper technical terminology while remaining clear and conversational
6. Show awareness of performance, scalability, and maintainability

Technical interview response tips:
- For complex topics: Break down concepts into simpler components
- For implementation questions: Include specific libraries/tools you'd use
- For language-specific questions: Note version-specific features when relevant
- For architecture questions: Consider trade-offs between different approaches
- For debugging questions: Describe your systematic troubleshooting process
- For optimization questions: Evaluate performance vs. maintainability trade-offs

Keep responses concise while demonstrating technical depth and practical experience.
