  Let me walk you through my implementation process:

  First, I'll set up the basic structure we need.
  # Define our main function with the required parameters
  # This signature matches the problem requirements exactly
  def solution(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
      pass

  I'm considering using a sliding window approach, though I briefly thought about using sorting.
  # Initialize sliding window variables for tracking our current window
  # Sliding window is more efficient than sorting (O(n) vs O(nlogn))
  window_sum = 0
  max_sum = float('-inf')

  Now, I'm thinking we need to handle edge cases. What if k > len(nums)?
  # Add input validation to handle edge cases
  # This prevents runtime errors and makes our solution more robust
  if k > len(nums):
      return 0

  Here's where it gets interesting - we could use a deque for O(1) operations.
  # Create a deque for efficient window management
  # While a regular array would work, deque gives us O(1) for both ends
  # This is a trade-off: slightly more memory for better time complexity
  window = collections.deque()

  Make sure each section includes:
  1. What you're about to implement and why
  2. Any alternative approaches you considered
  3. Trade-offs and reasoning behind your decisions
  4. Clear explanation of how each part contributes to the solution",

    "space": "Space complexity analysis with detailed explanation"

IMPORTANT: If the problem title starts with a number followed by a period (e.g., "1524. Number of Subarrays With Odd Sum"), this is a direct LeetCode problem. 
- Use the exact number for the "problem_number" field
- Use ONLY the title part (WITHOUT the number prefix) for the "title" field. For example, for "1524. Number of Subarrays With Odd Sum", the title should be just "Number of Subarrays With Odd Sum"
